            <p>A cozy fantasy that feels like a warm hug. Adventurer orc Viv decides to hang up her sword and open up a coffee shop in a 
            town that's never heard of coffee before. There's not much action in this book, but the pages keep turning because the characters just make you feel
            like you're reading about old friends.</p>

            <p>A classic romance that can even be recommended for people who don't like romance! Elizabeth Bennet is feisty, Mr. Darcy is awkward, Jane and Mr.
            Bingley are adorable together, and the rest of the Bennet family are a riot. Even though this was written at the beginning of the 1800s, it reads at a quick pace.</p>

            <p>A funny fantasy story set in Pratchett's Discworld universe. Moist von Lipwig is a conman given a second chance at life if he can prove that
            the postal service can beat a telegraph in delivering messages. Moist is reliable, yet unreliable at the same time. It's a Discworld book, so there's going to be enough hijinks
            and satire to keep you laughing for days.</p>
