            <p>Hello and welcome, one and all! My name is Kaitlyn and I'm a geek, plain and simple. I started reading at a young age, was playing video games once I hit double digits, and introduced myself to comics once I reached adulthood. 
            This site was created so that I could rate and review what I devour for these hobbies for all of you! I hope you try something new and exciting for you in all of the reviews on this site.</p>
